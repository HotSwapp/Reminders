	<h2 class="styled-heading">Why Email Reminders?</h2>

	<p>It's happened to all of us countless times: "<em>Why didn't I remember to...</em>". 
		And while todo lists go a long way, sometimes we fail to open them - whether
	 on holidays or weekends...or just out of depression from how much work we have to do.</p>
	 <p>
	 	RemindMe allows you to schedule important notes, which will be emailed to you
	 	on the dates that you specify. It's a simple enough idea, but can be a life saver 
	 	for those of us who can barely remember what they ate for dinner last night.
